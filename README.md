This code helps you classify different digits using softmax regression

## Description
Softmax Regression (synonyms: Multinomial Logistic, Maximum Entropy Classifier, or just Multi-class Logistic Regression) is a generalization of logistic regression that we can use for multi-class classification (under the assumption that the classes /are mutually exclusive). In contrast, we use the (standard) Logistic Regression model in binary classification tasks.
